## Dockerized Runtime

This codebase ships with a Docker stack that provisions the Laravel API, the WhatsApp gateway, and supporting infrastructure (MySQL, Redis, queue worker, and scheduler).

### Prerequisites

- Docker Engine 24+
- Docker Compose v2

### Setup

1. Copy the sample environment file and adjust secrets (`APP_KEY`, payment gateways, email providers, etc.).
   - `cp docker/env.docker.example .env.docker`
2. Build the images and start the services.
   - `docker compose build`
   - `docker compose up -d`
3. Run the first-time bootstrap commands.
   - `docker compose exec app php artisan key:generate --force --env=.env.docker`
   - `docker compose exec app php artisan migrate --force`
   - `docker compose exec app php artisan db:seed --force` (optional demo data)

The Laravel API is available at `http://localhost:8080` and the WhatsApp gateway REST API at `http://localhost:8002`.

### Service Map

- `app`: PHP-FPM container serving the Laravel backend
- `web`: Nginx reverse proxy serving public assets and proxying PHP-FPM
- `queue`: long-running `php artisan queue:work`
- `scheduler`: continuous `php artisan schedule:work`
- `wa-server`: Node.js WhatsApp gateway (`@adiwajshing/baileys`)
- `db`: MySQL 8 primary database
- `redis`: Redis 7 cache/queue backend

### Operational Notes

- Application code is baked into the images. Rebuild (`docker compose build`) after code changes you need to run within containers.
- Persistent data is stored in named volumes (`storage`, `uploads`, `sessions-data`, `db-data`, `redis-data`).
- Follow logs with `docker compose logs -f app` or `docker compose logs -f wa-server`.
- Tear down everything (including volumes) with `docker compose down -v`.

## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.
